## Questions

I haven't implemented a feature yet, I've been having a lot of technical issues, sorry.

Also, sorry for turning this in late, it slipped my mind last night. :(

I will be implementing the correct API endpoints today or Monday, though.

1. Link to the pull request you are most proud of.
2. Why are you proud of this feature? What was difficult about its implementation?
3. How does this feature help the user?
4. Think about the process of delivering this feature: from ideation, to scoping, to pairing, to testing. Knowing what you know now, what would you change about the way in which you delivered this feature?
