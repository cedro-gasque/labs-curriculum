# Module Inquiry 3

## Questions

1. What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?
Today, I worked on connecting Elastic Beanstalk with S3. This will allow us to interact with backend and ML.
2. When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?
I was the driver. I haven't programmed much at all until today, as we're still working with AWS. I prefer the driver, just because I can pick up the slack when the navigator doesn't know Python.
3. What was difficult about being a navigator?
From my experience outside of lambda, it's being unable to play with the code yourself.
4. How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?
When I navigate, I have to type out the code myself or I will be completely unable to explain it.
