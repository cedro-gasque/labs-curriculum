# Sprint Challenge: Sprint 3

## Objectives

- Student demonstrates they can provide useful feedback to their peers.
- Student can respond productively to critical feedback from their peers and articulate its contribution to their professional development.

On the job, you will be responsible for giving feedback to your peers. Here are some what some hiring managers said about feedback.
- "We're looking for candidates that are receptive to feedback during the interview process (like if they get stuck on a whiteboard question)". "We're looking for candidates that are excited to learn, willing/able to learn from other engineers." "During the interview, we try pushing back on something they did. They should be very open to feedback."
- "As much as possible I'm looking for experiences, examples, and team work that can indicate they will be successful. Are they open to feedback, interested in learning, work together in teams."

## Prompt 1 - Giving Feedback

### Questions you need to answer

1. What's an example of an issue you've had in working with another team member? How have you addressed it?

The only issues I remember having are ones I never effectively resolved. I'm not really sure what to put here because all the issues I remember having in a team seem to me to come from my own faults. I am hypercritical of myself and hypocritical of others.

2. What are some benefits and challenges to working with the different personalities and work styles on your team? Please provide an example.

Some benefits to working with different personalities are new ways to look at a problem, and difficulties are when work ethic clashes, in my experience. I struggle to be productive, so sometimes it feels hard to work with productive people, simply because I compare myself to them.

## Prompt 2 - Receiving Feedback

### Questions you need to answer


1. How do your teammates tend to describe you?
I'd assume smart but unfocused.
2. What's the most difficult piece of feedback you've ever received?
I'm not sure, really. I don't often receive feedback that I don't expect.
3. How have you incorporated that feedback into your personal development?
I don't have the resources for personal development yet.

## Prompt 3 - Professional Development GitHub Profile

In giving and receiving feedback, you learn how others see you. You also discover how you'd like to be seen. Take the feedback you've received and use it to help write about yourself -- incorporate that information into a GitHub Profile README. During your job search, you'll find that many applications ask you to link to your GitHub. Use GitHub as a tool to promote yourself by ensuring you have the following checked off:

**Link your github profile as your submission for this prompt**
[Profile here](https://github.com/cedro-gasque)
## Profile Photo and Name

- [ ]  Profile photo is a clear headshot, bitmoji, or avatar of myself, not the GitHub logo.
- [x]  Name and username displayed is professional and contains a variation of my name.
- [ ]  Other relevant profiles like `Portfolio` or `Twitter` are linked in my bio.

**Example:**

## Profile README

GitHub now features a profile README section that is customizable. This section will appear above your pinned projects, giving you the opportunity to do some branding and marketing about yourself. If you're new to this feature, check out the first 4 minutes of this *[How to Create a GitHub Profile README](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1z7_GfEPiE).* There are also [templates](https://github.com/kautukkundan/Awesome-Profile-README-templates) and [ideas](https://twitter.com/sudo_overflow/status/1281146411736694784?s=21) to get you started on a [personal README](https://dev.to/satvikchachra/how-to-add-an-awesome-readme-to-your-github-profile-361n).

For the purpose of endorsement, include the following information in your README:

- [ ]  Introductory message that welcomes viewers to your page
- [ ]  2-3 quick bullets or sentences that describe yourself: this can include passions, interests, expertise, and what you currently do
- [ ]  Reference skills and expertise you have
- [ ]  Contact information to let others know how they can send you a message

**Example:**

- Here's a short and sweet example you can find in the open-source templates:
