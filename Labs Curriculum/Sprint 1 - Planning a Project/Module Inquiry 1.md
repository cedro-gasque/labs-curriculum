# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
I couldn't ask it myself, as my mic was (and probably still is) broken, but a major issue with the goals of the app is COPPA. I think it'll be hard or impossible to have any privacy between students and parents.

2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
 - As a parent, I should be able to create and log into my account and create a kid account under it, and monitor their progress.
 - As a student, I should be able to read and tell stories.

3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
The parents needs to receive analytics from the student's accounts.
This would be done using statistical analysis on the cloud.
Deliver this with an API and a cache?
Account and verification are done through Okta?
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
    I don't really know how Okta works, and there is a major issue of privacy.
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
I think I missed the user story part of the process, or maybe I just didn't understand it. I would be more mindful during that part, so I can more effectively break down the tasks.
